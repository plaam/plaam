#### Hi there 👋 I'm Dan.
A 17 year old, freelance developer & software engineer.

##### Education 🎓
Henceforward, I'm studying Computer Science at my education center, moreover, I'm spending a lot of time on self-improvement by getting valuable courses and learning new programming languages. In addition, I've finished CS50x computer science course, Thinkful web development course and some others.

##### Programming languages 🔧
My first programming language was C++, and I'm still being involved in the learning process, but personally, I believe that current education state is pretty high.</br>
As for now, I'm pretty good at front-end part *(especially: JavaScript - TypeScript, HTML&CSS, rudimentary knowledge of PHP)*. </br>
Hopefully, 2022 will bring me an ability to learn C#, since it's actually mostly compared to C++ for its OOP prospects.</br>

##### Projects 👨🏻‍💻
Currently, I've not got enough free time to contribute to some public projects, but apparently, I'll be trying to divide the time between self-learning and participating at projects.
