#### Hi there 👋 I'm Dan.
A 17 year old, freelance developer & software engineer, IT administrator.

##### Education 🎓
Henceforward, I'm studying Computer Science at my education centre, moreover, I'm spending a lot of time on self-improvement by getting valuable courses and learning new programming languages.
In addition, I've finished CS50x computer science course, and learning C# now.

##### Programming languages 🔧
My first programming language was C++, and I'm still being involved in the learning process, but personally, I believe that current education state is pretty high.
As for now, I'm pretty good at front-end part *(especially: JavaScript - TypeScript, HTML&CSS, rudimentary knowledge of php)*. 
Hopefully, 2022 will bring me an ability to learn C#, since it's actually mostly compared to C++ for OOP prospects.

##### Projects 👨🏻‍💻
Currently, I've not got enough free time to contribute to some public projects, but as for now, I'm trying to divide the time between self learning and participating at projects.
